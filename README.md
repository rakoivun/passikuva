## Detailed process

- Take a photo 
  - Good approach is to use natural light (not direct)
  - Put the subject some 1-1.5 meters from a white wall to avoid shadows
  - Step back some 2-3 meters to avoid distortion of the small mobile phone lens 
  - Instructions on what kind of photo is acceptable from Finnish police: https://lupakuvienvastaanotto.fi/FaceImageHelp/Photography.aspx

- Upload the photo to police database: 
  - Sign in as a private person: https://lupakuvienvastaanotto.fi/Login/Login.aspx
    - Register as a private person if not registered yet
  - Upload the processed image by following the instructions: https://lupakuvienvastaanotto.fi/NewPhoto/AddNewPhotoView.aspx
    - You will be given guidance on what is acceptable, etc. Check carefully
    - At the end, you will get a code like "ACD UKL ZK8" 
      - This is the code you will need when applying for ID or passport - so keep it safe
      - Note that there is a BUG or discrepancy that the real code is without spaces, i.e., "ACD UKL ZK8" -> "ACDUKLZK8" when applying for a passport at lupakuvienvastaanotto

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Image Processing**: Pillow (PIL)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas
- **Styling**: CSS3

## Implementation Details

The application uses HTML5 Canvas for live photo manipulation, allowing users to interact with their photos in real-time. The Flask backend processes the final image to ensure it meets exact pixel dimensions and format requirements.

Guide lines are positioned at exact pixel measurements matching official passport photo requirements. The central canvas is precisely 500x653 pixels, matching the final output dimensions.
