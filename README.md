## Detailed process

- Take a photo 
  - Good approach is to use natural light (not direct)
  - Put the subject some 1-1.5 meters from a white wall to avoid shadows
  - Step back some 2-3 meters to avoid distortion of the small mobile phone lens. Here subject standing on a sofa and I have zoomed in a bit with my mobile phone.
  - It's sufficient that the "right behind the head" part is flatly illuminated. There is slight shadow on the left but I think it is ok.
  - No kittens where harmed!

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Image Processing**: Pillow (PIL)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas
- **Styling**: CSS3

## Implementation Details

The application uses HTML5 Canvas for live photo manipulation, allowing users to interact with their photos in real-time. The Flask backend processes the final image to ensure it meets exact pixel dimensions and format requirements.

Guide lines are positioned at exact pixel measurements matching official passport photo requirements. The central canvas is precisely 500x653 pixels, matching the final output dimensions.
